# Week 3 challenge - Password Generator

Description:
In this module we needed to create a password generator to allow a password between 8 and 128 characters.  When you click on Generate button it will ask you how many characters.  Try putting in less then 8 and more then 129  to test that it will not allow you to be that low or high.  Now select a number between 8 and 128 and then it will ask if you want numbers, uppercase, lowercase and Special Characters.

In full disclosure i asked a friend help me to debug the code.  He didn't write any code just helped identify area I need to research the solutions.
